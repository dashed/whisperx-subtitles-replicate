# Model Information

WhisperX provides fast automatic speech recognition (70x realtime with large-v3) with word-level timestamps and speaker diarization.

Whisper is an ASR model developed by OpenAI, trained on a large dataset of diverse audio. Whilst it does produces highly accurate transcriptions, the corresponding timestamps are at the utterance-level, not per word, and can be inaccurate by several seconds. OpenAIâ€™s whisper does not natively support batching, but WhisperX does.

Model used is for transcription is large-v3 from faster-whisper.

For more information about WhisperX, including implementation details, see the [WhisperX github repo](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX).
